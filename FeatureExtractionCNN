"""
**CNN for detecting faults/cracks, etc in images of glass lenses**
Acquire images of the glass: This could be done using a camera or other imaging device.
Pre-process the images: This might involve tasks such as noise reduction, color correction, or edge enhancement to improve the quality of the images and make it easier to detect cracks.
Extract features from the images: This could involve using techniques such as edge detection or texture analysis to identify features in the images that are indicative of cracks.
Train a machine learning model: Using the extracted features, a machine learning model could be trained to classify images as containing cracks or not containing cracks.
Test the model: The trained model could be tested on a set of images that it has not seen before to evaluate its performance.
Use the model to detect cracks in new images: Once the model has been trained and tested, it can be used to detect cracks in new images of glass.
